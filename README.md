# shopify-flask-webhook-dispatcher

This Flask app allows to catch Shopify webhooks events and trigger actions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Set up 
To start the app, first set up a virtual environment, activate it and install the needed dependencies.

```sh
$ virtualenv -p python3 venv --no-site-package
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create the needed environment variables.
```sh
$ export HMAC_SECRET=<shared secret signed from Shopify webhook>
$ export FLASK_ENV=<development/production>

$ export FLASK_APP=shopify_listener
```

Launch the app.
```sh
python3 -m flask run --host='0.0.0.0'
```

The activity is logged in a file `logs.log`
```

_**Hint for testing:** It's not possible to link Shopify webhooks from localhost. For testing you can use [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to get a temporary domain._

## üß© Allocate actions to events
You can allocate different actions to do while an event is catched using the private functions in `dispatcher.py`  

**Example**  
The webhook topic `orders/create` is called.  
The `dispatch_event()` function will redirect the event to the private function `_orders_create()`.  
In this case, `_orders_create()` will retrieve the order id and customer email to send this data to an internal api.

```python
# dispatcher.py


class Dispatcher:

    # ......
    
    def _orders_create(self):
    	"""orders/create.
        
        If order created, send order id and customer email to internal API.
        """
        url = 'https://<domain>/api/<endpoint>'
        r = requests.post(url, data={'order_id': self.data['id'], 'customer_email': self.data['email']})
        return r.content
```
