# shopify-flask-webhook-dispatcher

This app allows to catch and dispatch actions from Shopify webhooks events.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Set up 
To start the app, first set up a virtual environment and install the needed dependencies.

```sh
$ virtualenv -p python3 venv --no-site-package
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Export the needed environment variables
```sh
$ export HMAC_SECRET=<shared secret signed from Shopify webhook>
$ export FLASK_ENV=<development/production>

$ export FLASK_APP=shopify_listener
```

Launch the app.
```sh
python3 -m flask run --host='0.0.0.0'
```

The activity is logged in a file `logs.log`
```

_**Hint for testing:** It's not possible to link Shopify webhooks to localhost. So for testing you can use [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to get a temporary domain._

## üß© Allocate actions to events
You can allocate differents actions using the private functions in `dispatcher.py`  

**Example**  
The webhook topic `orders/create` is called.  
Our `dispatch_event()` function will know it has to call `_orders_create()`.  
In our case, `_orders_create()` will retrieve the order id and customer email to send this data to an internal api.

```python
# dispatcher.py


class Dispatcher:
    """Dispatch the different webhook events to the related functions.

    The list of all webhook events can be found at:
    https://help.shopify.com/en/api/reference/events/webhook
    """

    def __init__(self, data):
        """Init webhook data."""
        self.data = data

    @staticmethod
    def name_topic(topic):
        """Rename the topic event to match the function names."""
        return "_" + topic.replace('/', '_')

    def dispatch_event(self, topic):
        """Dispatch the event to the correct function."""
        return getattr(self, self.name_topic(topic))()
       
    # ......
    
    def _orders_cancelled(self):
    	"""orders/cancelled.
        
        If order cancelled, do nothing as not implemented.
        """
        pass
        
    def _orders_create(self):
    	"""orders/create.
        
        If order created, send order id and customer email to internal API.
        """
    	order_id, email = self.data['id'], self.data['email']
        url = 'https://<domain>/api/<endpoint>'
        r = requests.post(url, data={'order_id': order_id, 'customer_email': email})
        return r.content
```
